# Spring 6 RestTemplate

Spring RestTemplate is a part of the Spring Framework, specifically in the Spring Web 
module, that provided a higher-level, more convenient way to make HTTP requests to 
RESTful web services. It simplified the process of interacting with RESTful APIs by 
abstracting away much of the low-level HTTP communication and providing a more intuitive 
Java-based API for making HTTP requests.

## Repository Description

This repository uses Spring RestTemplate to make HTTP requests to que spring6-playground 
repository, available in my profile. Both applications need to be running in order to
function properly.
